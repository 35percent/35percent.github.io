The original plans proposed the scheme be supplied by 100% on-site generated renewable energy but the final consented scheme will provide just 1%.

The original regeneration plans proposed a [Multi-Utility Services Co.](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2270) (MUSCo) renewable energy plant, which was [supposed](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1814/Elephant_and_Castle_Regeneration_Agreement_Appendix_6.pdf) to provide _"the generation of renewable energy"_ in a _"sustainable network of heat, water and telecoms"_ for all new developments at the Elephant. The MUSCo was going to generate 100% renewable energy from a biomass energy centre making the Elephant & Castle regeneration a 'zero carbon' development with 'carbon positive' homes.

The MUSCo was also [going to supply](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=16241) the new Aylesbury estate development and the existing Salisbury and Newington housing estates, making it the [largest biomass-fuelled district heating network](/images/muscoarea.png) in London. The plans were so cutting edge that they were [praised](https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8056859.stm) by Bill Clinton and [included](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6032) in the [C40 Climate Positive Development Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Positive_Development_Program)._ However, the plans have been dropped because the costs were too high. The scheme had become a _'fairy tale fantasy'_ [according](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5052) to the Council's own cabinet member for regeneration. Now, instead the Elephant & Castle shopping centre/UAL development will [provide just 35 solar panels](https://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!ocfCH8IZNlNKf8lwnyuxDQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) representing a measly 1% renewable energy. This falls well short, not just of the Council's zero carbon policy for the Elephant & Castle but also its borough-wide policy requiring a minimum 20% renewable energy for all new major schemes.
