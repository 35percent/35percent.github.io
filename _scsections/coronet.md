Delancey dismissed the [campaign](https://coronettheatre.co.uk/home/save-the-coronet/){:target="_blank"} to save [The Coronet](https://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/3344-coronet-london){:target="_blank"}. The Coronet takes up a sizeable part of the shopping centre site. A music and event venue, it has also been a cinema and music hall [dating back to 1872](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7701){:target="_blank"} and is a popular local institution. Attempts have been made to have it listed on the basis of its Art Deco interior and exterior, which currently remains [hidden](https://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SNcoronet.pdf){:target="_blank"} behind its blue corrugated facade, but Delancey's scheme will see the venue bulldozed. The [Theatres Trust](https://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} submitted a [strong objection](planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!mXJGLVs8phU8UfW%2b%2fP0kZA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d){:target="_blank"} to Delancey's planning application.
