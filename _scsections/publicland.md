 [Land Registry Records](https://35percent.org/lrdeeds/shoppingcentreCouncilFreeholdLand.pdf) show that the Council is handing over a considerable amount of public realm to Delancey for its disastrous and inqequitable redevelopment of the E&C shopping centre.

The [S106 legal agreement](https://35percent.org/img/ShoppingCentreS106.pdf) shows that the entire public realm in Delancey's redeveloped Elephant & Castle will be privately managed and the Delancey reserves the right to 'eject' anyone it considers an 'annoyance':
