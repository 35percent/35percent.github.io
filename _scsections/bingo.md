Palace Bingo hall on the first floor of the shopping centre is an important local community facilty, accommodating around 500 pensioners daily. Southwark's [planning committee report](https://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!HvOs1eG7BYgl0hYZ8SIm5w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) acknowledges that the bingo hall is _"clearly a popular and well-used facility"_ and _"that a high proportion of elderly people and people from Black, Asian and Minority
Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds use the facility, and its loss could result in adverse equality implications."_ It then goes on to explain that this is 'mitigated' by Delancey's offer to give 'first right of refusal' to a bingo operator for use of some of the new leisure space in its scheme (para 125).  

In Palace Bingo's [response to this](https://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!mlQECLDoZucrky0D%2fJLzhw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) it said: _"At the time of publishing the report and your Cabinet meeting there had been no dialogue[with Delancey], and subsequent discussions have not been meaningful or substantive thus far."_ In March 2019 the Bingo Hall closed and the operator has no plans to return to the redeveloped centre.
