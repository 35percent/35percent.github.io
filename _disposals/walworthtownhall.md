In 2019, Southwark resolved to sell Walworth Town Hall on a long lease to developers [General Projects Ltd](https://www.generalprojects.com/portfolio/walworth-town-hall/).

Local heritage group The Walworth Society says that whilst the plans include some 'community workspace' it won't include any genuinely publicly accessible space.
