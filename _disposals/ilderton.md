In 2016, Southwark Council [resolved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=5885) to sell this council owned-strip of land on Ilderton Road for an undisclosed sum to a developer. In 2020, the developer was granted planning permission for a series of 25-storey buildings. Shortly after obtaining planning permission the plot was put up for sale.
