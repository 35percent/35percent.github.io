In September 2018 Southwark Council [resolved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=50017404&PlanId=0&Opt=3#AI50577) to sell this commercial site that it owned on the Old Kent Road to developer Barkwest Ltd for an undisclosed sum. Land registry [records](/lrdeeds/RegisterPlanSGL285666.pdf) show that Southwark is still the owner of the site, but that it is subject to an agreement for sale to Barkwest. The [Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s77421/Report%20Disposal%20of%20councils%20freehold%20interest%20at%20Devonshire%20Grove%20to%20rear%20of%20745-775%20Old%20Kent%20Roa.pdf) authorising the sale says that the land won't be transferred until the scheme has been implemented. 

A year later it [purchased](https://oldkentroad.org.uk/council-to-purchase-more-development-land-in-old-kent-road/) an adjacent site from developers for an undisclosed sum. [Land Registry records](/lrdeeds/RegisterPlan289108.pdf) show that the Council paid Â£12.3m for the site.
