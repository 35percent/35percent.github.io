In September 2018 Southwark Council [resolved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=50017404&PlanId=0&Opt=3#AI50577) to sell this commercial site that it owned on the Old Kent Road to developer Barkwest Ltd for an undisclosed sum.

A year later it [purchased](https://oldkentroad.org.uk/council-to-purchase-more-development-land-in-old-kent-road/) an adjacent site from developers for an undisclosed sum.
