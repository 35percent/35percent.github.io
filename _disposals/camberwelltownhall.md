Camberwell Town Hall served as Southwark's civic centre for all its meetings and core administrative functions for nearly half a century. In December 2014, Southwark's Labour administration [sold it](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/town-halls-residence-students-move-former-southwark-town-hall-peckham/) [to a Jersey-based developer (Alumno Developments)](https://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_PeckhamTownHall.pdf). 

A week after the sale Southwark [granted planning permission](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s42948/Item%201%20and%202%20report.pdf) for the building's conversion into private flats to be used as student accommodation. The affordable housing quota was waived on the basis of a viability assessment submitted by the developer.

The building is now let as luxury student accommodation where a single room will [set you back](https://www.gold.ac.uk/accommodation/halls/town-hall-camberwell/) circa £200 per week and a studio £300 per week.
