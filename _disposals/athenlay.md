In 2013 Southwark Council [resolved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=50001541&PlanId=0&Opt=3#AI27615) to sell a plot of land on Athenlay road in Peckham, which had previously housed a series of post-war pre-fab bungalows. 
The site has now been redeveloped as entirely private housing.
