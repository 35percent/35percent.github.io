In 2019 Southwark Council [resolved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=6723) to sell Cherry Gardens primary school on Southwark Park Road in Bermdonsey. It has entered into a joint-venture agreement with developer Higgins to redevelop the site as housing. The plans involve the construction of 56 homes of which initially 18 were to be retained by the Council as council homes. In 2020, this number was [increased](https://www.se16.com/6815-cherry-garden-school-redevelopment-to-be-50-council-homes) to 26 after local Councillors complained about the use of scarce public land to build predominantly private housing.
