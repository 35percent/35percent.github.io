In 2016, Southwark Council resolved to close its day centre on Southwark Park Road. It subsequently [entered](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/former-southwark-park-day-centre-to-be-turned-into-flats/) into a joint venture with developer Lovell for the site which involves the construction of 46 new homes, of which just 22 at 'social/affordable' rents.
