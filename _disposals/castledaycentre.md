The Castle Day Centre was a council-owned day centre for people with mental health problems. In 2012, the Council [resolved](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5867) to close the centre. It was subsequently demolished and the Council spent Â£5m constructing a new church on the site as a replacement for the Crossway Baptist Church on the Heygate estate, that the Council aquired and demolished using CPO powers.
