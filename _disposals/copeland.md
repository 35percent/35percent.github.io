In 2019 Southwark Council [resolved](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=6813) to sell its Copeland Road Car Park to developer Purelake Homes. It was subsequently awarded planning permission for 67 new homes [of which just 24](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/housing/new-council-homes/where-we-re-building/rye-lane/copeland-road-car-park-se15) will be council homes.
