In 2013, as part of the Council's [Bermonsey Spa regeneration](/bermondsey-spa), a council office block (Mable Goldwyn House) and the adjointing residential care centre for adults with learning disabilities (Gibson House); and a centre for learning disability services (Evelyn Coyle House), were all [sold](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s38849/Report%20Disposal%20of%20The%20Grange%20Sites%20C2%20and%20C4%20Bermondsey%20Spa%20London%20SE1.pdf) to developer Linden Homes. The Council subsequently granted planning permission for 167 residential units, of which 34 were to be social rent. As has [become routine](/redefining-social-rent) in Southwark, these were instead provided as 'affordable rent' (i.e. up to 80% market rent).
