Whilst the initial decision to redevelop Elephant & Castle was taken behind closed doors [in June 1998](http://betterelephant.github.io/images/strategic24June.pdf), it was formally designeated an 'Opportunity Area' in Southwark's 2002 Unitary Development Plan and its [2002 E&C SPG](https://35percent.org/img/2002SPG.pdf). 

The subsequent [2002 Masterplan](https://35percent.org/img/slrplans.pdf) pledged that all of the Council homes lost through the [redevelopment](https://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration) of the Heygate estate would be replaced, 50% of which on the redeveloped estate footprint:

This hasn't happened, mainly because Southwark Council has [rolled over](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) to developers along the way. Now of the 5,937 new homes being built at the Elephant a grand total of 298 will be social rent (4%) and a question mark hangs over whether half of these will be built by the developer or at the council's cost. Doubt also remains over the [question](https://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) of whether the small number of social rented homes built to date have been provided as such and not at 80% market rent.

The Council's [planning policy for the Elephant and Castle](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/supplementary-planning-documents-spd/spd-by-area?chapter=4) requires a minimum of 17.5% of new homes to be social rent. Had it stuck by its planning policy then these schemes would have provided over a thousand much-needed new social rented homes at no cost to the Council.

Instead, over a thousand council homes elsewhere in the borough have been taken up by the [diaspora](https://www.35percent.org/the-heygate-diaspora/) of former Heygate tenants, who were originally promised new homes at the Elephant.

The original plans for the Elephant and Castle opportunity area envisaged 4,200 new homes including over 1,000 replacement council homes. In the event the number of homes has already been exceed by nearly a third and not one replacement council home has been built in the opportunity area.

Some people are asking whether the revolving doors](https://35percent.org/revolving-doors) between Southwark's elected representatives and property developers at the Elephant may have played a role in Southwark's failure to secure a more equitable outcome for the regeneration.

For example, Council leader Peter John led Southwark from 2010 to 2020 and was the one who signed the [questionable](https://www.35percent.org/no-profit-share-the-true-value-of-the-heygate-regeneration/) development partnership agreement with Lendlease:

![](https://35percent.org/img/pjdl.jpg)

Immediately after stepping down he was [appointed Chairman](https://www.35percent.org/former-council-leader-slides-through-the-revolving-doors/) of the [Terrapin Group](https://www.terrapingroup.co.uk/ourPeople/17), a lobbying firm, whose client list is dominated by property developers including the Council's development partner for the Heygate estate (Lendlease) and the E&C shopping centre (Delancey).

[^1]: Southwark gave planning consent to this scheme (as many others) allowing it to forgo the requirement to provide social rented housing. This scheme was however required to provide 115 intermediate affordable homes. These were then [purchased](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s71644/Report%20Acquisition%20of%20Affordable%20Housing%20at%20Longville%20Road%20SE11.pdf) by Southwark Council from the developer for an undisclosed sum in 2018. 79 homes are now let by the Council as council homes, the remaining 36 are being [let](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88184/Report%20Letting%20Churchyard%20Row.pdf) at intermediate rents to households on the Council's new [intermediate housing waiting list](https://consultations.southwark.gov.uk/housing-community-services-department-community-engagement-team/intermediate-housing-list/).
