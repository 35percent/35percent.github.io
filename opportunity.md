Whilst the initial decision to redevelop Elephant & Castle was taken behind closed doors [in June 1998](http://betterelephant.github.io/images/strategic24June.pdf), it wasn't until 2002 that it first identified as an 'Opportunity Area' in Southwark's 2002 Unitary Development Plan and its [2002 E&C SPG](https://35percent.org/img/2002SPG.pdf). 

The original [2002 Masterplan](https://35percent.org/img/slrplans.pdf) pledged that all of the Council homes lost through the [redevelopment](https://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration) of the Heygate estate would be replaced, 50% of which on the redeveloped estate footprint:

This hasn't happened, mainly because Southwark Council has [rolled over](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) to developers along the way. Now of the 5,937 new homes being built at the Elephant a grand total of 216 will be social rent (3%) and a question mark hangs over whether half of these will be built by the developer's or the council's cost. Doubt also remains over the [question](https://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) of whether the small number of social rented homes built to date have been provided as such and not at 80% market rent.

The Council's planning policy for the Elephant and Castle requires a minimum of 17.5% of new homes to be social rent. Had it stuck by its planning policy then these schemes would have provided over a thousand much-needed new social rented homes at no cost to the Council.

Instead, over a thousand council homes elsewhere in the borough have been taken up by the [diaspora](https://www.35percent.org/the-heygate-diaspora/) of former Heygate tenants who were originally promised they would get new homes at the Elephant.
