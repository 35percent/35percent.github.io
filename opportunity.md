The Elephant & Castle was first identified as an 'Opportunity Area' in Southwark's 2002 Unitary Development Plan and its [2002 E&C SPG](https://35percent.org/img/2002SPG.pdf). 

The original [2002 Masterplan](https://35percent.org/img/slrplans.pdf) pledged that all of the Council homes on the Heygate estate would be replaced, 50% of which on the redeveloped estate footprint:

This hasn't happened, mainly because Southwark Council has [rolled over](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) to developers along the way. Now of the 5,937 new homes being built at the Elephant a grand total of 216 will be social rent (3%) and a question mark hangs over whether half of these will be built by the developer's or the council's cost.

The Council's planning policy for the Elephant and Castle requires a minimum of 17.5% of new homes to be social rent. Had it stuck by its planning policy then these schemes would have provided over a thousand much-needed new social rented homes at no cost to the Council. The Council's failure at Elephant and Castle mirrors its <a href="/major-schemes">ongoing failure</a> to secure affordable housing from developers in major schemes across the borough.

The Council claims that it is delivering new 'council homes' in the area like <a href="https://35percent.org/2017-04-29-blackfriars-affordable-housing-circus/">these ones at Blackfriars Road</a>, but it continues to <a href="/the-southwark-clearances">sell off and knock down</a> existing council homes <a href="https://35percent.org/2018-11-12-11000-council-homes-manifesto-pledge/">faster</a> than it is building new ones.
