### Southwark  to change rules to allow office block on former Heygate estate.

Southwark Council are set to change its planning rules to enable developer Lendlease to build an office block on the site of the former Heygate estate.  The block would be on the final development plot of Elephant Park, Plot H1, which is earmarked for housing under Lendlease's current planning consent (LINK).  Lendlease has now applied to replace this consent with an entirely new one, to build an office block, not housing.
