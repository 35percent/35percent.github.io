### Southwark  to change rules to allow office block on former Heygate estate.

Southwark Council are set to change its planning rules to enable developer Lendlease to build an office block on the site of the former Heygate estate.  The block would be on the final development plot of Elephant Park, Plot H1, which is earmarked for housing under Lendlease's current planning consent (LINK).  Lendlease has now applied to replace this consent with an entirely new one, to build an office block, not housing.

Southwark is also ready to change the New Southwark Plan (NSP) to pave Lendlease's way to a successful planning approval of the application.  The change will allow an increase in the office floorspace on Elephant Park, from the maximum of 5,000 sqm that Lendlease is presently allowed, to the 57,454 sqm it is proposing in its new planning application (LINK).  Southwark has said *'an office development on this plot is broadly supported'* in pre-application discussions with Lendlease.

### Late changes to the New Southwark Plan

The change to the NSP, which governs all development throughout the borough, is being made as a 'main modification' to the Plan.  The modification would allow 60,000 sqm to be built specifically on Elephant Park; at the moment the local plan envisages a maximum of 30,000 sqm of *'business floorspace'* for the whole Elephant and Castle Opportunity Area (LINK).  The modification also removes Plot H1 from the NSP housing trajectory, the anticipated pipeline for new housing in the borough.

The NSP, including the main modifications, is in the final stages of approval by government inspectors.  Comments on all proposed modifications can be made up to a deadline of September 24 (LINK). 35% Campaign's draft comment can be found here (LINK).

### From open space to office space

A good part of Plot H1 sits on land that was covenanted for use as open space, in perpetuity, when ownership was devolved to Southwark in 1985, on the abolition of the Greater London Council (GLC) (Check -LINK).  In 2014 Southwark transferred ownership of the Heygate land, including Plot H1, to Lendlease, removing the covenant in the process.

In 2019 Lendlease took advantage of a poorly drafted s106 legal agreement with Southwark to increase the maximum number of homes allowed on Elephant Park by 220 units, to 2,689 (LINK).  Lendlease is using ten plots of land for these homes, instead of the eleven available, leaving itself a spare plot.  This is the justification for the new planning application.  Lendlease claims that they have fulfilled their housing obligations under the current planning consent, so Plot H1 can be used for an office development, which would create jobs.

Lendlease does not say in their new planning application how many homes could be built on Plot H1, if it were used as for housing as originally intended, but by making a rough comparison with neighbouring plot H7, a capacity for about 340 homes can be calculated.
