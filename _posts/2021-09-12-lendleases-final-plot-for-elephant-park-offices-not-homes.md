### Southwark  to change rules to allow office block on former Heygate estate.

Southwark Council are set to change its planning rules to enable developer Lendlease to build an office block on the site of the former Heygate estate.  The block would be on the final development plot of Elephant Park, Plot H1, which is earmarked for housing under Lendlease's current planning consent (LINK).  Lendlease has now applied to replace this consent with an entirely new one, to build an office block, not housing.

Southwark is also ready to change the New Southwark Plan (NSP) to pave Lendlease's way to a successful planning approval of the application.  The change will allow an increase in the office floorspace on Elephant Park, from the maximum of 5,000 sqm that Lendlease is presently allowed, to the 57,454 sqm it is proposing in its new planning application (LINK).  Southwark has said *'an office development on this plot is broadly supported'* in pre-application discussions with Lendlease.

### Late changes to the New Southwark Plan

The change to the NSP, which governs all development throughout the borough, is being made as a 'main modification' to the Plan.  The modification would allow 60,000 sqm to be built specifically on Elephant Park; at the moment the local plan envisages a maximum of 30,000 sqm of *'business floorspace'* for the whole Elephant and Castle Opportunity Area (LINK).  The modification also removes Plot H1 from the NSP housing trajectory, the anticipated pipeline for new housing in the borough.
