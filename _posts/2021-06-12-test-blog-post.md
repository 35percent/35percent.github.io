This is a test blog post to try and find out what this persist error is all about.

Ok - trying to save now.

### Final decision goes Delancey's way

The Appeal Court has upheld the High Court decision allowing developers Delancey to proceed with the demolition and redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre, after it found that there were no grounds for reersing the High Court's decision.

The legal challenge was mounted as part of a hard-fought campaign by the Up the Elephant.  This brought together housing campaigners (including the 35% Campaign), students, tenants' groups, local councillors and trade unionists, in the fight for more social rented housing and a better deal for traders displaced by the proposed development.

Despite the legal outcome the Up the Elephant Campaign secured many improvements to the original proposals, compared to the baseline of the original application, made in October 2016.

* Increase of social rented housing from 33 units of 'social rent equivalent', owned and managed by the developer, to 116 proper social rented units, owned and managed by the Council or housing association
* Provision of affordable retail space
* An established traders' panel
* Temporary traders' premises on Castle Square
* Trader relocation to Elephant Arcade (Perronet House)
* Trader relocation and assistance funds of £634,000 and £200,000
* 15-year affordable retail lease

### What we have lost

Despite these improvements Delancey's scheme still remained a bad one, hence the legal challenge.  The shopping centre may have been shabby, but it housed one of the largest bingo halls in Britain, much used by older people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds, with a bowling alley next door, equally popular with younger people.  It had over decades become one of two social hubs for Latin Americans living in London (along with Wards Corner, in Seven Sisters).  Most of the other independent traders come from other parts of the world and had built for themselves and their families.  All this would be lost.  And while the affordable housing 'offer' was improved it still did not meet Southwark's minimum policy requirements, falling short by over fifty homes for social rent.

### The GLA grant mystery

The status of a purported £11.4m grant from the Mayor, that allowed Delancey to improve the social rented housing offer from 74 to 116 units and how this was reported to the planning committee was a key question before the court. The planning committee was told variously that the grant was *'an agreement in pricinciple for grant funding'* (Officer's report Adden. para 11), or *'recently confirmed'* (OR 371), when in fact it was neither.  There was no grant and no application had been made.  Delancey had only been advised by the Greater London Authority (GLA) that an application would be welcome (Appeal Judgement  para 87) and of the steps that they needed to take to make an application.

On this point, the appeal court ruled that while there had been an *'overstatement'* (AJ 87) of the position, all-in-all the committee had not been misled, paricularly as Delancey had committed to building the social rented housing, with or without grant.

This commitment naturally led the legal challenge to argue that if Dlancey could provide 116 social rented units without grant, they should be able to provide more with grant.  Again, the appeal court did not agree, citing the viability assessment, which stated that 116 units was *'the maximum reasonable amount'* of social rented housing, and accepting that Delancey was committed to building the social rented housing at their own risk, even if grant were not available (AJ 91).
