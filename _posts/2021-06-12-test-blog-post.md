Ok - trying to save now.

### Final decision goes Delancey's way

The Appeal Court has upheld the High Court decision allowing developers Delancey to proceed with the demolition and redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre, after it found that there were no grounds for reersing the High Court's decision.

The legal challenge was mounted as part of a hard-fought campaign by the Up the Elephant.  This brought together housing campaigners (including the 35% Campaign), students, tenants' groups, local councillors and trade unionists, in the fight for more social rented housing and a better deal for traders displaced by the proposed development.

Despite the legal outcome the Up the Elephant Campaign secured many improvements to the original proposals, compared to the baseline of the original application, made in October 2016.

* Increase of social rented housing from 33 units of 'social rent equivalent', owned and managed by the developer, to 116 proper social rented units, owned and managed by the Council or housing association
* Provision of affordable retail space
* An established traders' panel
* Temporary traders' premises on Castle Square
* Trader relocation to Elephant Arcade (Perronet House)
* Trader relocation and assistance funds of £634,000 and £200,000
* 15-year affordable retail lease

### What we have lost

Despite these improvements Delancey's scheme still remains a bad one, hence the legal challenge.  The shopping centre may have been shabby, but it housed one of the largest bingo halls in Britain, much used by older people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds, with a bowling alley next door, equally popular with younger people.  It had over decades become one of two social hubs for Latin Americans living in London.
