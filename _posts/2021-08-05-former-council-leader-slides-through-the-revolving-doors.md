Former Council leader Peter John has joined the [growing number](https://www.35percent.org/revolving-doors/) of former Council bosses now working for developers.

He was recently [appointed Chairman](https://www.terrapingroup.co.uk/ourPeople/17) of Terrapin Communications, a lobbying firm for property developers:

Terrapin is owned by former Tory politician Peter Bingle, who has a long [track record](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning) of using local government politicans to [help developers get planning consent](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning).

The [Public Affairs Board Register](https://register.prca.org.uk/register/previous-registers/) shows that Elephant & Castle developer Delancey and Heygate estate developer Lendlease among Terrapin's long term clients.

Other clients include Barratt Homes, which has a [number of major schemes in Southwark](https://www.35percent.org/blackfriars-circus/) and several developers with schemes down the Old Kent Road.

Peter John's relationship with Terrapin's Peter Bingle spans the full ten years of his leadership at Southwark Council. The [Register of Interests](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgDeclarationSubmission.aspx?UID=189&HID=1954&FID=0&HPID=0) shows a number of dinners paid for by Terrapin, Bingle himself or his previous company - the [disgraced Bell Pottinger](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41245719)

Peter John's appointment as Terrapin's new Chairman raises some serious questions about Southwark Council's dealings with developers over the last 10 years. 

If Southwark had an effective, non-partisan, independent Scrutiny Committee (which it doesn't) this would be a good time to look back through the major schemes signed off by Peter John to see if he was acting in the Council's or developer's best interest at the time.
