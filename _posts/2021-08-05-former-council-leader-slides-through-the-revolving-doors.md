Former Council leader Peter John has joined the [growing number](https://www.35percent.org/revolving-doors/) of former Council bosses now working for developers.

He was recently [appointed Chairman](https://www.terrapingroup.co.uk/ourPeople/17) of Terrapin Communications, a lobbying firm for property developers:

Terrapin is owned by former Tory politician Peter Bingle, who has a long [track record](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning) of using local government politicans to [help developers get planning consent](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning).

The [Public Affairs Board Register](https://register.prca.org.uk/register/previous-registers/) shows that Elephant & Castle developer Delancey and Heygate estate developer Lendlease among Terrapin's long term clients.

Other clients include Barratt Homes, which has a [number of major schemes in Southwark](https://www.35percent.org/blackfriars-circus/) and several developers with schemes down the Old Kent Road.
