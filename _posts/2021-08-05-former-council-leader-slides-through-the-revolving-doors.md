Former Council leader [Peter John OBE](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/exclusive-council-leader-steps-down-after-ten-years/) has joined the [long list](https://www.35percent.org/revolving-doors/) of councillors and ex-council staff now working for property developers.  Cllr John was leader from 2010 to 2020, as well as being chair of [London Councils](https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/) from 2018 to 2020. 

Cllr John was recently [appointed Chairman](https://www.terrapingroup.co.uk/ourPeople/17) of the Terrapin Group, a lobbying firm whose [client list](https://www.terrapingroup.co.uk/ourClients) is dominated by property developers and investors.  Cllr John joins three other serving councillors, from different boroughs, as a Terrapin 'practioner'.

Terrapin was founded former Tory politician Peter Bingle in 2012 and has acquired a [reputation](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning) for lobbying local government politicans to [help developers get planning consents](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning).

The [Public Affairs Board Register](https://register.prca.org.uk/register/previous-registers/) shows Elephant & Castle developer Delancey is one of Terrapin's oldest clients, having benefited from their consultancy services since 2013.  The [Elephant Park](https://www.elephantpark.co.uk/) (formerly Heygate estate) developer [Lendlease](https://www.elephantpark.co.uk/about-elephant-park/lendlease/) was also on Terrapins books for 4 years, from 2013 to 2017. 

Other Terrapin clients with schemes in Southwark include Barratt Homes (from 2013 to 2017; [Blackfriars Circus, Maple Quays, the Galleria, Redwood Park](https://www.35percent.org/blackfriars-circus/)); Telford Homes (from 2019; [Bermondsey Works](https://www.se16.com/2287-telford-homes-rotherhithe-new-road)), Hollybrook Homes Ltd (2018 - 2020; [Eagle Wharf](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=ZZZV0LKBWR146)) and Bellway Homes (from 2013; [Elmington estate regeneration](https://www.35percent.org/elmington-regeneration/), Phase 3).

The biggest developer in the [Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans-section/old-kent-road-aap), Avanton Ltd was also a Terrapin client from 2017 to 2019.  [Avanton is behind](https://avanton.co.uk/project/avanton-old-kent-road/?single) the [approved Ruby Triangle development](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications-old/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9577483) and the upcoming [Gasworks and Carpetright schemes](https://avanton.co.uk/2019/12/03/avanton-acquires-gasholders-site-on-old-kent-road-for-230-million-mixed-use-regeneration-project/), which together will have over 2,100 homes.[ Ruby Triangle Properties Ltd](https://www.35percent.org/ruby-triangle-goes-to-committee/) was also on Terrapin's books, from 2017 to 2019, as was its affordable housing partner [A2 Dominion](https://a2dominion.co.uk/en), for earlier periods.



Peter John's relationship with Terrapin's Peter Bingle spans the full ten years of his leadership at Southwark. The Council's [Register of Interests](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgDeclarationSubmission.aspx?UID=189&HID=1954&FID=0&HPID=0) shows a number of dinners paid for by Terrapin, Bingle himself or his previous company - the [disgraced Bell Pottinger](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41245719)

Peter John's appointment as Terrapin's new Chairman raises some serious questions about Southwark Council's dealings with developers.

Here are some of the controversial schemes signed off during his 10 years as Council leader:

## Heygate estate redevelopment

In july 2010, just months after taking the reigns at Southwark, Peter John signed a development agreement with Lendlease for the redevelopment of the Heygate estate.

![](/img/screenshot-2021-08-06-at-10-25-18-elephant-castle-regeneration-agreement-formally-signed.png)

It later [emerged](https://www.35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/#the-deal-with-lendlease) that the deal involved a payment to the Council of just £50m for the 25 acre site - barely enough to cover the cost incurred by the Council in emptying the estate.

Of the 3,000 new homes being built by Lendlease the deal secured just 100 at social rent.

See more info about the Heygate deal [here](https://www.35percent.org/heygate-profits-north-of-a-hundred-million/) and [here](https://35percent.github.io/heygate-regeneration/)

Peter John [came under fire](http://heygatewashome.org/img/SNOlympicTickets.pdf) in 2012 for accepting tickets to the Olympics paid for by Lendlease [and a trip to Cannes in 2013](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/yacht-cannes-selling-homes-local-government-officials-mipim). 

## Aylesbury estate redevelopment

In 2014, Peter John signed off the sale of 2,759 council homes and 60 acres of land at the Aylesbury estate to Private Registered Provider Notting Hill Genesis. Whilst the deal required Notting Hill Genesis to provide 50% 'affordable housing' it failed to secure any of the 3,500 proposed new homes as council homes.

After political pressure mounted, last year Southwark Council was [forced to U-turn](https://www.35percent.org/aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) on its agreement with Notting Hill and fork out £193m so that 581 new homes in phase 1 of the scheme will be converted to council homes for tenants being 'decanted'.  

## Canada Water redevelopment

In 2018, Peter John signed off the sale of 15 hectares of council-owned land at Canada Water to developer British Land as well as the Seven Islands Leisure centre.

![](https://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CanadaWaterSiteC.png)

The deal secured just 35% affordable housing, well below the Council's 50% minimum requirement for public-owned land. 

It is unknown what land receipts (if any) the Council will receive in return, because the [development agreement](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/canada-water?chapter=6&article) with British Land has been heavily redacted.

## Elephant & Castle shopping centre

Whilst the Council hasn't signed a partnership agreement with shopping centre developer Delancey, it has provided CPO powers to clear the site of traders and has signed over a small parcel of council-owned land. 

In 2018, Peter John took the unusual step of [announcing his support](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9599) for [Delancey's scheme](https://www.35percent.org/shopping-centre/) even though it exceeded the Council's density requirements for the site and didn't meet with minimum requirements for social rented housing or offer any reprovision for existing traders.

![](/img/screenshot-2021-08-06-at-11-50-04-interview-cllr-peter-john-southwark-labour-leader.png)

It was only after a concerted campaign and legal action that Delancey improved its offer from 33 to 116 social rented homes and agreed to provide relocation units for some of the traders.

Delancey has also been involved in other schemes in the borough, including 185 Park Street (next to Tate Modern). Southwark's planning committee [granted permission](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8388) for 169 new homes in 2015 - none of which affordable.

## Letting developers off the hook

The Park Street scheme is no exception - our [research](https://35percent.org/major-schemes) into major developments approved in Southwark over the past 10 years has shown that out of a total of 11,863 new homes given planning consent, just 456 (3.8%) were social rented tenure. Had the Council stood firm and forced these schemes to comply with minimum policy requirements then 2,500 social rented homes would have been delivered in total.

## Fire sale of Council-owned buildings and land

In his ten years as Council leader Peter John oversaw [the sale of](https://www.35percent.org/estates/firesale/) a significant amount of council-owned land and buildings including all three Town Halls.

It is unlikely that we will ever know to what extent Terrapin's lobbying on behalf of its clients has had on our Council administration's decisions during the last decade. The world of lobbying and revolving doors is opaque, but there are three simple steps that Southwark's current administration could take to clear up its act:

1. Conduct a review of the legal agreements for the major joint-venture developments listed above, to ensure that the Council is getting value for money and/or adequate remuneration for its land (and exercise break clauses if it is not).
2. Introduce a voluntary code of conduct for Councillors such that they agree not to work for lobbyists during or after their term in public service.
3. Prevent Councillors from being wined and dined or receiving gifts from developers or their lobbyists - i.e. all meetings with developers or their representatives should be conducted in Council offices and be fully minuted by officers.

This would help Southwark Council restore some integrity and avoid damaging headlines such as [these](https://crappistmartin.github.io/images/private-eye-southwark-council-developers.png):

Given the [number of former and sitting Councillors](https://35percent.org/revolving-doors) on lobbyists' payrolls and the fact that Peter John has retained his seat as a ward Councillor, we won't be holding our breath..
