Former Council leader Peter John has joined the [long list](https://www.35percent.org/revolving-doors/) of former Council bosses now working for developers.

He was recently [appointed Chairman](https://www.terrapingroup.co.uk/ourPeople/17) of Terrapin Communications, a lobbying firm for property developers:

Terrapin is owned by former Tory politician Peter Bingle and has a murky [reputation](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning) of using local government politicans to [help developers get planning consent](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning).

The [Public Affairs Board Register](https://register.prca.org.uk/register/previous-registers/) shows Elephant & Castle developer Delancey and Heygate estate developer Lendlease among Terrapin's long term clients.

Other clients include Barratt Homes, which has a [number of major schemes in Southwark](https://www.35percent.org/blackfriars-circus/), Telford Homes, Hollybrook and Bellway Homes ([Elmington estate regeneration](https://www.35percent.org/elmington-regeneration/)), which also each have several schemes in Southwark.

Terrapin's clients also include many of the developers behind the recently-approved Old Kent Road schemes, including the [Ruby Triangle](https://www.35percent.org/ruby-triangle-goes-to-committee/), [Southernwood Retail Park](https://www.35percent.org/southernwood-retail-park/), the [Gas works site](https://avanton.co.uk/2019/12/03/avanton-acquires-gasholders-site-on-old-kent-road-for-230-million-mixed-use-regeneration-project/), the [Bermondsey Works](https://www.35percent.org/bermondsey-works/) and the Carpetright site.

Peter John's relationship with Terrapin's Peter Bingle spans the full ten years of his leadership at Southwark. The Council's [Register of Interests](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgDeclarationSubmission.aspx?UID=189&HID=1954&FID=0&HPID=0) shows a number of dinners paid for by Terrapin, Bingle himself or his previous company - the [disgraced Bell Pottinger](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41245719)

Peter John's appointment as Terrapin's new Chairman raises some serious questions about Southwark Council's dealings with developers over the last 10 years. 

If Southwark had an effective, non-partisan, independent Scrutiny Committee (which it doesn't) this would be a good time to look back through the major schemes signed off by Peter John to ensure that he was acting in the Council's rather than the developer's best interest at the time.

Here are some of the controversial schemes signed off by Peter John during his 10 years as Council leader:

## Heygate estate redevelopment

In july 2010, just months after taking the reigns at Southwark, Peter John signed a development agreement with Lendlease for the redevelopment of the Heygate estate.

![](/img/screenshot-2021-08-06-at-10-25-18-elephant-castle-regeneration-agreement-formally-signed.png)

It later [emerged](https://www.35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/#the-deal-with-lendlease) that the deal involved a payment to the Council of just £50m for the 25 acre site - barely enough to cover the cost incurred by the Council in emptying the estate.

Of the 3,000 new homes being built by Lendlease the deal secured just 100 at social rent.

See more info about the Heygate deal [here](https://www.35percent.org/heygate-profits-north-of-a-hundred-million/) and [here](https://35percent.github.io/heygate-regeneration/)

Peter John [came under fire](http://heygatewashome.org/img/SNOlympicTickets.pdf) in 2012 for accepting tickets to the Olympics paid for by Lendlease [and a trip to Cannes in 2013](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/yacht-cannes-selling-homes-local-government-officials-mipim). 

## Aylesbury estate redevelopment

In 2014, Peter John signed off the sale of 2,759 council homes and 60 acres of land at the Aylesbury estate to Private Registered Provider Notting Hill Genesis. Whilst the deal required Notting Hill Genesis to provide 50% 'affordable housing' it failed to secure any of the 3,500 proposed new homes as council homes.

After political pressure mounted, last year Southwark Council was [forced to U-turn](https://www.35percent.org/aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) on its agreement with Notting Hill and fork out £193m so that 581 new homes in phase 1 of the scheme will be council homes for tenants being 'decanted'.  

## Canada Water redevelopment

In 2018, Peter John signed off the sale of 15 hectares of council-owned land at Canada Water to developer British Land as well as the Seven Islands Leisure centre.

![](https://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CanadaWaterSiteC.png)

The deal secured just 35% affordable housing, well below the Council's 50% minimum requirement for public-owned land. 

It is unknown what land receipts (if any) the Council will receive in return, because the [development agreement](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/canada-water?chapter=6&article) with British Land has been heavily redacted.

## Elephant & Castle shopping centre

Whilst the Council hasn't signed a partnership agreement with shopping centre developer Delancey, it has provided CPO powers to clear the site of traders and has signed over a small parcel of council-owned land. 

In 2018, Peter John took the unusual step of [announcing his support](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9599) for [Delancey's scheme](https://www.35percent.org/shopping-centre/) even though it exceeded the Council's density requirements for the site and didn't meet with minimum requirements for social rented housing or offer any reprovision for existing traders.

![](/img/screenshot-2021-08-06-at-11-50-04-interview-cllr-peter-john-southwark-labour-leader.png)

It was only after a concerted campaign and legal action that Delancey improved its offer from 33 to 116 social rented homes and agreed to provide relocation units for some of the traders.

Delancey has also been involved in other schemes in the borough, including 185 Park Street (next to Tate Modern). Southwark's planning committee [granted permission](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8388) for 169 new homes in 2015 - none of which affordable.

## Letting developers off the hook

The Park Street scheme is no exception - our [research](https://35percent.org/major-schemes) into major developments approved in Southwark over the past 10 years has shown that out of a total of 11,863 new homes given planning consent, just 456 (3.8%) were social rented tenure. Had the Council stood firm and forced these schemes to comply with minimum policy requirements then 2,500 social rented homes would have been delivered in total.

## Fire sale of Council-owned buildings and land

In his ten years as Council leader Peter John oversaw [the sale of](https://www.35percent.org/estates/firesale/) a significant amount of council-owned land and buildings including all three Town Halls.

It is unlikely that we will ever know to what extent Terrapin's lobbying on behalf of its clients has had on our Council administration's decisions during the last decade. The world of lobbying and revolving doors is opaque, but there are steps that Southwark's current administration could take to clear up its act:

1. Conduct a review of the legal agreements for the major developments listed above, to ensure that the Council is getting value for money and/or adequate remuneration for its land (and exercise break clauses if it is not).

2. Introduce a voluntary code of conduct for Councillors such that they agree not to work for lobbyists during or after their term in public service.

3. Prevent Councillors from being wined and dined or receiving gifts by developers or their lobbyists. All meetings with developers or their representatives should be in a formal Council environment and fully minuted.

This will help Southwark restore some integrity and avoid headlines such as these:

Given the [number of former and sitting Councillors](https://35percent.org/revolving-doors) on the lobbyists payroll, we won't be holding our breath..
