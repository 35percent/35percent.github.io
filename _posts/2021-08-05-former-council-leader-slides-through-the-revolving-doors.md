Former Council leader Peter John has joined the [growing number](https://www.35percent.org/revolving-doors/) of former Council bosses now working for developers.

He was recently [appointed Chairman](https://www.terrapingroup.co.uk/ourPeople/17) of Terrapin Communications, a lobbying firm for property developers:

Terrapin is owned by former Tory politician Peter Bingle, who has a long [track record](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning) of using local government politicans to [help developers get planning consent](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/home-builders-lobbyist-pushed-council-leader-to-sort-and-speed-planning).

The [Public Affairs Board Register](https://register.prca.org.uk/register/previous-registers/) shows that Elephant & Castle developer Delancey and Heygate estate developer Lendlease among Terrapin's long term clients.

Other clients include Barratt Homes, which has a [number of major schemes in Southwark](https://www.35percent.org/blackfriars-circus/) and several developers with schemes down the Old Kent Road.

Peter John's relationship with Terrapin's Peter Bingle spans the full ten years of his leadership at Southwark Council. The [Register of Interests](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgDeclarationSubmission.aspx?UID=189&HID=1954&FID=0&HPID=0) shows a number of dinners paid for by Terrapin, Bingle himself or his previous company - the [disgraced Bell Pottinger](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41245719)

Peter John's appointment as Terrapin's new Chairman raises some serious questions about Southwark Council's dealings with developers over the last 10 years. 

If Southwark had an effective, non-partisan, independent Scrutiny Committee (which it doesn't) this would be a good time to look back through the major schemes signed off by Peter John to ensure that he was acting in the Council's rather than the developer's best interest at the time.

Here are some of the schemes signed off by Peter John that may warrant further scrutiny:

## Heygate estate redevelopment

In july 2010, just months after taking the reigns at Southwark, Peter John signed a development agreement with Lendlease for the redevelopment of the Heygate estate.

It later [emerged](https://www.35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/#the-deal-with-lendlease) that the deal involved a payment to the Council of just £50m for the 25-acre site - not enough to even cover the cost incurred by the Council in emptying the estate.

Of the 3,000 new homes being built by Lendlease the deal secured just 100 at social rent.

See more info about the Heygate deal [here](https://www.35percent.org/heygate-profits-north-of-a-hundred-million/) and [here](https://35percent.github.io/heygate-regeneration/)

Peter John [came under fire](http://heygatewashome.org/img/SNOlympicTickets.pdf) in 2012 for accepting tickets to the Olympics paid for by Lendlease [and a trip to Cannes in 2014](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/yacht-cannes-selling-homes-local-government-officials-mipim). 

## Aylesbury estate redevelopment

In 2014, Peter John signed off the sale of 2,759 council homes and 60 acres of land at the Aylesbury estate to Private Registered Provider Notting Hill Genesis. The deal required Notting Hill to provide 50% 'affordable housing' but failed to secure any of the 3,500 new homes as council homes.

After political pressure mounte, last year Southwark Council was [forced to U-turn](https://www.35percent.org/aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) on its agreement with Notting Hill and fork out £193m so that at least 581 new homes in phase 1 of the scheme will be council homes for tenants being 'decanted'.  

## Canada Water redevelopment

In 2018, Peter John signed off the sale of 15 hectares of council-owned land at Canada Water to developer British Land as well as the Seven Islands Leisure centre.

The deal secured just 35% affordable housing, well below the Council's 50% minimum requirement for public-owned land. 

It is unknown what land receipts (if any) the Council will receive in return, because the [development agreement](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/canada-water?chapter=6&article) with British Land has been heavily redacted.

## Council-owned buildings and land
In his ten years as Council leader Peter John oversaw the sale of a significant amount of council-owned land and buildings including all three Town Halls.
