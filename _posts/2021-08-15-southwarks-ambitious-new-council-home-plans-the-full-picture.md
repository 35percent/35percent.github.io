title: Southwark's ambitious new council home plans - the full picture

Last week Southwark Council bulldozers moved in to fence off Peckham green, amid protests from local residents against the loss of green space.

The Council says that it needs to build new council homes (including shared ownership) on the green because it has no other land to build them on.

We're not against building new council homes, but for five reasons, we do think it's a bit off to go building on the small amount of remaing precious green space the borough has.

## 1. Estate demolitions

Southwark has lost around 7,000 council homes to its extensive and ongoing estate redevelopment programme.

The programme continues and there are currently 569 (structurally sound) empty council homes on the Aylsebury estate awaiting demolition. The Aylesbury scheme involves the demolition of 2,759 homes in total.

Last year 450 council homes were earmarked for demolition on the Tustin estate.

It's a bit rich to start building council homes on green space because you've got nowhere else to build them when you are simultaneously knocking down thousands of structurally sound council homes on nearby estates.

## 2. Council-owned land and property sell offs
For the past ten years, Southwark has had a ['void disposal policy'](https://www.35percent.org/estates/void-disposals/) which triggers the sale of any Council home that becomes void and is valued at over Â£400k.

The theory goes that the Council can use the proceeds of the sales to build new council homes, but it fails to take into account the shortage of land upon which to build.

At the same time the Council has been [selling off council-owned buildings and council owned land](https://www.35percent.org/estates/firesale/) to developers for redevelopment as housing:

Most of the above sites have either been converted or are being redeveloped as (mainly private) housing. Their sale has not resulted in a single council or social rent home.

The land sales are a similar story..

## 3. Major schemes
Our [research](https://35percent.org/major-schemes) shows that only 456 new homes, out of 11,863 units in 25 major developments, approved in Southwark from 2006 to 2016 were social rented tenure - 3.8%. Had these schemes to complied with minimum policy requirements then around 2,500 social rented homes would have provided for families on Southwark's housing waiting list.

It's a bit rich to claim that green spaces have to be given over to new council homes when you've forgone 2,500 social rented homes by letting developers off the hook.

## 4. Lost section 106 housing
Even in the schemes which have provided social rented housing as part of the 35% affordable housing requirement, the council is entirely unconcerned as to whether the social rented housing is provided.
