Last week Southwark Council bulldozers moved in to fence off Peckham green, amid protests from local residents against the loss of green space.

The Council says that it needs to build new council homes (including shared ownership) on the green because it has no other land to build them on.

We're not against building new council homes, but for three reasons we do think it's a bit off to go building on the small amount of remaing precious green space the borough has.

1. Estate demolitions

Southwark has lost around 7,000 council homes to its extensive and ongoing estate redevelopment programme.

The programme continues and there are currently 569 (structurally sound) empty council homes on the Aylsebury estate awaiting demolition. The Aylesbury scheme involves the demolition of 2,759 homes in total.

Last year 450 council homes were earmarked for demolition on the Tustin estate.

It's a bit rich to start building council homes on green space because you've got nowhere else to build them when you are simultaneously knocking down thousands of structurally sound council homes on nearby estates.

2. Land and street property sell offs
