Southwark Council's agreement for the Elephant shopping centre redevelopment waived a payment of £46.6m from the developer Delancey, in the event of Southwark taking over the construction of the social rented housing.

Delancey agreed to provide 116 social rented units, as a late concession to secure planning permission, in July 2018.  It also agreed to provide 'land and a sum of money sufficient for the construction......., if it had not itself commenced building the units within ten years (of the development commencing).

This arrangement also  appeared in a note for the 'heads of terms' of the legal s106 agreement', drafted by Delancey's planning consultant DS2, which said in almost identical words that if Southwark took over the work, Delancey would transfer the land and pay Southwark 'the sum of \[£    ], leaving the precise amount blank.

At some point between between 

Worst case scenario - S get land overvalued with Delancey claiming it meets construction costs  - plus £1!  Delancey's track - record - previous blog

How has Southwark got itself inot a position where this is even a possibility?

Unfortunately given Delancey the option to hand over construction, not retained it for itself.

A clearly defined cash payment has been lost.

Best option for Southwark now is to insist on option 1; renegotiate s106; let RP take over - retain money to build 116 council homes elsewhere.
