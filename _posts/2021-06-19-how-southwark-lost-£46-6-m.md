### How Southwark lost the chance of £46.6 m. on the shopping centre redevelopment

Southwark Council has waived a payment of £46.6m from developer Delancey in their legal agreement for the redevelopment of the Elephant & Castle shopping centre. The payment would have been made by Delancey in the event of Southwark having to take over the construction of the 116 social rented units in the scheme, but never found its way into the final s106 agreement

Delancey agreed to build the social rented homes in DATE, after it failed to secure planning permission for the shopping centre's redevelopment at its first attempt.   Delancey also agreed that if it had not started building the homes itself within ten years, it would provide the land and the money for Southwark or a housing association, for them to do so instead.

This arrangement first appeared in a note about the 'heads of terms' of the legal s106 agreement', drafted by Delancey's planning consultant DS2, in June 2018.  The note said that if Southwark took over the work, Delancey would transfer the land *'and pay to the Council or a Registered Provider....'the sum of \[£    ] for the purposes of construction and completion of the West Site Social rented Units'*, leaving the precise amount blank.

### 'Land and a sum of money'

The planning committee approved Delancey's scheme, including this arrangement, on DATE July  2018.  The report said;

*'The s106 agreement would therefore stipulate that if the development  on the west site has not substantially commenced within 10 years of the east site commencing, the land and a sum of money sufficient for the construction and completion of the social rented units would be transferred to the council, to deliver the social rented units'.* (OR364).

Come October 2016 words to this effect duly appeared in an early draft of the s106, saying that Delancey would transfer the land to the Council (or housing association) and '*..pay to the Council or Registered Provider ...the sum of **£46,636,200** (Forty six million, six hundred and thirty six thousand and two hundred pounds)'.*

However, this whole clause was struck through. The s106 now has with no cash figure for the payment and Delancey are no longer paying the full construction costs.  Instead it would pay an unspecified amount, *'equal to the Social Rented Construction Costs...less the value of the Social Rented Value of the ...Units' (*ref).

SCREENSHOT OF BOTH VERSIONS HERE?

By December 2018, there have been further changes.  A simple arrangement, where Delancey transfers the land and makes a specified payment, has been transformed into three options.  Option 1 is that Delancey build the units itself, for Southwark or a housing association to take on, the usual course under a s106 agreement.  The other two options require Southwark to meet upfront costs themselves (recouping these from selling or letting the non residential elements parts of the building) or getting the net social rent construction payment, the amount to be agreed or *'determined by the Specialist'*. 

### From £46.6m to £1 (one pound)

The most alarming of the options is Option 3.  This allows Delancey to simply transfer the land with a cash payment of £1 (one pound), with nothing else to be paid.  (The logic behind this is that the value of the non-residential parts makes up for any lost payment).

The situation becomes particularly alarming in the light of the appeal court judgement, which interpreted the phrase *the land and a sum of money sufficient for the construction* to mean not just the land in a physical sense, but also to include the value of the land ruled that the value of the land could be taken into account in the transaction.

In reaching this interpretation the court was adopting the reasoning, not just of Delancey's barrister, but of Southwark's own barrister, (who joined his colleague representing the offshore, tax-avoiding property developer, in painting the 'sum of money', needed by a local authority to build social housing, as a 'windfall' the simply were not entitled to, under the terms of s106 and according to planning regulations. 

   

### Who will pay for the social housing?

This sorry story has a clear trajectory. At the beginning, Southwark were looking at getting over £46m, if it has to build the social rented units, but at every each step in the subsequent negotiations Southwark has given ground to such an extent that, in a worst case scenario, it now faces getting nothing, in cash terms, depending on the value given to the land.

CITE AYLESBURY? FDS?

A worst case scenario for Southwark is of course a best case scenario for Delancey - clever work by lawyers it could be relieved of paying tens of millions in costs and given its track record - ST story -  Lister

 Worst case scenario - S get land overvalued with Delancey claiming it meets construction costs  - plus £1!  Delancey's track - record - previous blog

How has Southwark got itself inot a position where this is even a possibility?

Unfortunately Southwark has given Delancey the option to hand over construction, rather than not retain it for itself; one in a series of needless concessions made - BtR policy, viability, option to build, delay to social rented

A simple arrangement, easily understood, with a clearly defined cash payment from Delancey to Southwark has been lost. Instead we have a complicated arrangement of three options, two of which are replete with arguable costs and values, and provide Delancey with ample opportunity to pass the cost of building 

Getting long-lease hold, not freehold, although social rent appears to have been secured 'in perpetuity'.

Best option for Southwark now is to insist on option 1; renegotiate s106; let RP take over - retain money to build 116 council homes elsewhere.

Southwark could opt for net s/r costs, but this also entails establishing a land value - TRUE? OR - involves a complicated transaction of establishing costs and values, and we have no confidence in Southwark's ability to exercise this option without leaving itself out of pocket.
