Southwark Council has waived a payment of £46.6m from developer Delancey in their agreement for the redevelopment of the Elephant & Castle shopping centre. The payment would been made by Delancey in the event of Southwark taking over the construction of the 116 social rented units in the scheme.

Delancey agreed to build the social rented homes as a concession, after it failed to secure planning permission at the first attempt.  Delancey also agreed to provide the land and the money for Southwark to build the homes, if it had not started building the homes itself within ten years.

This arrangement first appeared in a note for the 'heads of terms' of the legal s106 agreement', drafted by Delancey's planning consultant DS2, in June 2015, which said if Southwark took over the work, Delancey would transfer the land and pay Southwark, or registered provider,'the sum of \[£    ], leaving the precise amount blank.

Unfortunately given Delancey the option to hand over construction, not retained it for itself.

A clearly defined cash payment has been lost.

Getting long-lease hold, not freehold, although social rent appears to have been secured 'in perpetuity'.

Best option for Southwark now is to insist on option 1; renegotiate s106; let RP take over - retain money to build 116 council homes elsewhere.
