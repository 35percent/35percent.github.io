Southwark Council's agreement for the Elephant shopping centre redevelopment waived a payment of £46.6m from the developer Delancey, in the event of Southwark taking over the construction of the social rented housing.

Delancey agreed to provide 116 social rented units, as a late concession to secure planning permission, in July 2018.  It also agreed to provide 'land and a sum of money sufficient for the construction......., if it had not itself commenced building the units within ten years (of the development commencing).

This arrangement duly appeared in a note for the 'heads of terms' of the legal s106 agreement', drafted by Delancey's planning consultant
