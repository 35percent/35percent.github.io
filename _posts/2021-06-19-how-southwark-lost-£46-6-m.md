title: How Southwark 'lost' £46.6 m at the Elephant

Southwark Council has waived a payment of £46.6m from developer Delancey in their legal agreement for the redevelopment of the Elephant & Castle shopping centre. The payment would have been made by Delancey in the event of Southwark having to take over the construction of the 116 social rented units in the scheme.

Delancey agreed to build the social rented homes in DATE, after it failed to secure planning permission for the shopping centre's redevelopment at its first attempt.   Delancey also agreed that if it had not started building the homes itself within ten years, it would provide the land and the money for Southwark or a housing association, for them to do so instead.

This arrangement first appeared in a note about the 'heads of terms' of the legal s106 agreement', drafted by Delancey's planning consultant DS2, in June 2018.  The note said that if Southwark took over the work, Delancey would transfer the land *'and pay to the Council or a Registered Provider....'the sum of \[£    ] for the purposes of construction and completion of the West Site Social rented Units'*, leaving the precise amount blank. 

The planning committee approved Delancey's scheme, including this arrangement, on DATE July  2018.  The report said;

*'The s106 agreement would therefore stipulate that if the development  on the west site has not substantially commenced within 10 years of the east site commencing, the land and a sum of money sufficient for the construction and completion of the social rented units would be transferred to the council, to deliver the social rented units'.* (OR364).

Words to this effect duly appeared in an early draft of the s106, saying that Delancey would transfer the land to the Council (or housing association) and '*..pay to the Council or Registered Provider ...the sum of **£46,636,200** (Forty six million, six hundred and thirty six thousand and two hundred pounds)'.*

However, this whole clause has been struck through. The s106 now has no cash figure for the payment and Delancey would no longer be paying the full construction costs.  Instead it would pay an unspecified amount, *'equal to the Social Rented Construction Costs...less the value of the Social Rented Value of the ...Units' (*ref).

By the time of the final draft of December 2018, this has become three options.  Option 1 is simply that Delancey build the units itself, for Southwark or a housing association to take on,the usual course under a s106 agreement.  The other two options require Southwark to meet upfront costs themselves (recouping these from selling or letting the non residential elements parts of the building) or getting a net social rent construction payment, the amount to be agreed or *'determined by the Specialist'*. 

There will no longer be any payment   



SCREENSHOT OF BOTH VERSIONS

### What the Court said

But the most alarming of the options is the third.  



### Who will pay for the social housing?

 Worst case scenario - S get land overvalued with Delancey claiming it meets construction costs  - plus £1!  Delancey's track - record - previous blog

How has Southwark got itself inot a position where this is even a possibility?

Unfortunately Southwark has given Delancey the option to hand over construction, rather than not retain it for itself; one in a series of needless concessions made - BtR policy, viability, option to build, delay to social rented

A simple arrangement, easily understood, with a clearly defined cash payment from Delancey to Southwark has been lost. Instead we have a complicated arrangement of three options, two of which are replete with arguable costs and values, and provide Delancey with ample opportunity to pass the cost of building 

Getting long-lease hold, not freehold, although social rent appears to have been secured 'in perpetuity'.

Best option for Southwark now is to insist on option 1; renegotiate s106; let RP take over - retain money to build 116 council homes elsewhere.

Southwark could opt for net s/r costs, but this also entails establishing a land value - TRUE? OR - involves a complicated transaction of establishing costs and values, and we have no confidence in Southwark's ability to exercise this option without leaving itself out of pocket.
