### Southwark to 'update' development contract with Notting Hill Genesis

Southwark Council's cabinet [agreed last week](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=7019&Ver=4) to increase the budget for its Aylesbury estate redevelopment costs by nearly Â£30m.  The money will be used to buy-out leaseholders, to allow for the estate's continued demolition and redevelopment.
