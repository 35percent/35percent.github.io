### Southwark to 'update' development contract with Notting Hill Genesis

Southwark Council's Cabinet [](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=7019&Ver=4)[has agreed](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=7019&Ver=4) to increase the budget for its Aylesbury estate redevelopment costs by nearly £30m.  The money will be used to buy-out leaseholders, to allow for the estate's continued demolition and redevelopment.

The Cabinet also approved a [further £13.32m](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s104415/Report Future of Aylesbury Estate.pdf>) to cover an overspend on an original budget of £75m for estate redevelopment.  £6.34m of this further expenditure is also for leaseholder buy-outs, with £6.97m for unspecified *'contract variations'*.

Discretionary disturbance payments totalling £165,000 to council tenants over 55 were also agreed. The extra money brings Southwark's reported total budget for estate redevelopment costs up to £118.29m, to come from the council's Housing Investment Programme.

### A new deal with Notting Hill Genesis

The same Cabinet meeting also agreed to make changes to the Development Partnership Agreement (DPA), the agreement made by Southwark with Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) for the estate's regeneration.  This deal was first struck in 2014; [major changes were made in 2019](https://www.35percent.org/aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) for the Aylesbury's First Development Site (FDS).  The FDS variations saw Southwark pay NHG a gross £210.8m for 581 council homes, while leaving revenue generating free-market housing with NHG.

No details were given in the public [report to the Cabinet](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s104415/Report%20Future%20of%20Aylesbury%20Estate.pdf) about any of the proposed changes, or *'variations'*, or whether any money will be paid to NHG.  A [closed report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgReasonsRestricted.aspx?ID=104420&OID=62848&OT=A&RPID=3453695&BM=AI62848) including financial details is unavailable to the public.

### The end of the Aylesbury Area Action Plan

In another significant event the [Aylesbury Area Action Plan (AAP)](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1647/Aylesbury-AAP-2010.pdf) is a step closer to being discarded.  Despite [protests from housing campaigners and residents](https://www.35percent.org/southwark-rips-up-aylesbury-objectives/) the a much slimmed-down AAP has [been  incorporated](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/73562/Main-Modifications-Appendix-7-Annex-5-AAP-policies-and-sites-replaced-by-NSP.pdf) into the [New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/75943/Southwark-Plan-2022-for-adoption-.pdf), along with the Canada Water and Peckham & Nunhead AAPs, after [approval by government inspectors](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan?chapter=10).  The AAP's generous [affordable housing space standards](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/73557/MAIN-51X.PDF) have been retained and there is now a new policy commitment, to *'reprovide 2,249 social rented homes'.*

### Social rent - no loss, but no gain

The social rent commitment is an important and welcome improvement on what would have been delivered under the outline planning permission held by NHG,  which allowed for a loss of between [778 and 1,166 social rented units](https://www.35percent.org/aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/).  But it will still mean that when the redevelopment is completed in 2036, we will have no more social rented housing on the estate, after 40 years, than [we had in 1998](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/13/aylesbury-estate-south-london-social-housing), when the Aylesbury regeneration began.

It also raises the question of how the deal between Southwark and NHG, sealed by the DPA and a legal s106 agreement, will be changed and how much it will cost Southwark to do this.  As we pointed out [when Southwark took over the FDS](https://www.35percent.org/aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/#fn:1) the price is likely to be high and any money spent on the Aylesbury is money that is not available for building council housing elsewhere in the borough.

The Cabinet has promised a further report on the new deal with NHG.  This must give full details its financial and other terms.  Under the original outline planning agreement NHG had to provide all the affordable housing, including the social rented housing, at its own cost.  Southwark must not simply take this over and pay NHG's tab.  NHG should pay for all the affordable and social rented housing that it agreed to; Southwark should only pay for anything above this, to ensure that the Aylesbury regeneration delivers the homes that Southwark needs, not just cash to NHG.

### **PS - Fakery by design**

We're glad to see that the fake bricks that were missing from the façade of one of the blocks on the First Development site have been replaced.

But it looks as if Southwark's explanation, that 'random' gaps had been [left by design](https://mobile.twitter.com/lb_southwark/status/1483060481854263296), to be filled by children's decorated bricks was equally fake.  All the replacement bricks look just like the rest.

Nonetheless, if we see any more bits drop off, we will be sure to let Southwark know.
