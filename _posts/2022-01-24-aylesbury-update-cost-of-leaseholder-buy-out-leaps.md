### Southwark to 'update' development contract with Notting Hill Genesis

Southwark Council's Cabinet [agreed last week](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=7019&Ver=4) to increase the budget for its Aylesbury estate redevelopment costs by nearly £30m.  The money will be used to buy-out leaseholders, to allow for the estate's continued demolition and redevelopment.

The Cabinet also approved a [further £13.32m](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s104415/Report Future of Aylesbury Estate.pdf>) to cover an overspend on an original budget of £75m for estate redevelopment.  £6.34m of the overspend is also for leaseholder buy-outs, with £6.97m for unspecified *'contract variations'*.

Discretionary disturbance payments totalling £165,000 to council tenants over 55 were also agreed. The extra money brings Southwark's reported total budget for estate redevelopment costs up to £118.29m, to come from the council's Housing Investment Programme.

### A new deal with Notting Hill Genesis

The same Cabinet meeting also agreed to make changes to the Development Partnership Agreement (DPA), the agreement made by Southwark with Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) for the estate's regeneration.  This deal was first struck in 2014; [major changes were made in 2019](https://www.35percent.org/aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) for the Aylesbury's First Development Site (FDS).  The FDS variations saw Southwark pay NHG a gross £210.8m for 581 council homes, while leaving revenue generating free-market housing with NHG.
