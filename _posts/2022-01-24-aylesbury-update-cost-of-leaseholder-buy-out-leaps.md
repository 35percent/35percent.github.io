### Southwark to 'update' development contract with Notting Hill Genesis

Southwark Council's Cabinet [agreed last week](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=7019&Ver=4) to increase the budget for its Aylesbury estate redevelopment costs by nearly £30m.  The money will be used to buy-out leaseholders, to allow for the estate's continued demolition and redevelopment.

The Cabinet also approved a [further £13.32m](<https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s104415/Report Future of Aylesbury Estate.pdf>) to cover an overspend on an original budget of £75m for estate redevelopment.  £6.34m of the overspend is also for leaseholder buy-outs, with £6.97m for unspecified *'contract variations'*.

Discretionary disturbance payments totalling £165,000 to council tenants over 55 were also agreed. The extra money brings Southwark's reported total budget for estate redevelopment costs up to £118.29m, to come from the council's Housing Investment Programme.

### A new deal with Notting Hill Genesis

The same Cabinet meeting also agreed to make changes to the Development Partnership Agreement (DPA), the agreement made by Southwark with Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) for the estate's regeneration.  This deal was first struck in 2014; [major changes were made in 2019](https://www.35percent.org/aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) for the Aylesbury's First Development Site (FDS).  The FDS variations saw Southwark pay NHG a gross £210.8m for 581 council homes, while leaving revenue generating free-market housing with NHG.

No details were given in the public [report to the Cabinet](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s104415/Report%20Future%20of%20Aylesbury%20Estate.pdf) about any of the proposed changes, or *'variations'*, or whether any money will be paid to NHG.  A [closed report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgReasonsRestricted.aspx?ID=104420&OID=62848&OT=A&RPID=3453695&BM=AI62848) including financial details is unavailable to the public.

### The end of the Aylesbury Area Action Plan

In another significant event the [Aylesbury Area Action Plan (AAP)](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1647/Aylesbury-AAP-2010.pdf) is a step closer to being discarded.  Despite [protests from housing campaigners and residents](https://www.35percent.org/southwark-rips-up-aylesbury-objectives/) the a much slimmed-down AAP has [been  incorporated](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/73562/Main-Modifications-Appendix-7-Annex-5-AAP-policies-and-sites-replaced-by-NSP.pdf) into the [New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/75943/Southwark-Plan-2022-for-adoption-.pdf), along with the Canada Water and Peckham & Nunhead AAPs, after [approval by government inspectors](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan?chapter=10).  The AAP's generous [affordable housing space standards](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/73557/MAIN-51X.PDF) have been retained and there is now a new policy commitment, to *'reprovide 2,249 social rented homes'.*
