### Traders deputation seeks fair treatment from developers; urges Southwark Council to act.

Independent traders displaced by the closure of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre are to send a deputation to the Southwark Council Assembly on 24 Nov 2021. The deputation wil be urging the Council to do more to help them secure new premises, after being left homeless by the shopping centre closure.

Many of the Elephant's former traders have shops and cafes in Castle Square, in Elephant Rd, and in the Elephant Arcade, after a three year campaign to secure new premises, but many others are still without trading spaces, including two of the Elephant and Castle's longest standing businesses, Pricebusters DIY and La Bodequita restaurant.
