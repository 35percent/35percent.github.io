### Traders deputation seeks fair treatment from developers; urges Southwark Council to act

Independent traders displaced by the closure of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre are to send a deputation to the Southwark Council Assembly on 24 Nov 2021. The deputation will be urging the Council to do more to help them secure new premises, after being left homeless by the shopping centre closure.

Many of the Elephant's former traders have shops and cafes in Castle Square, in Elephant Rd, and in the Elephant Arcade, after a three year campaign to secure new premises, but many others are still without trading spaces, including two of the Elephant and Castle's longest standing businesses, Pricebusters DIY and La Bodequita restaurant.

Both Pricebusters and La Bodequita have been offered new premises on Elephant Park, but have been unable to reach agreement with developers Delancey and Lendlease about who will meet the relocation costs.  Southwark Council has legal agreements with both developers covering traders' relocation requirements and the deputation will be asking Southwark to enforce these agreements.

### Traders 'very disappointed'

The owner of Pricebusters, Rakesh Patel, said *'We have been trading at the Elephant for 35 years, ever since the shopping centre opened.  We were the biggest DIY shop in the area and sold things people cannot get anywhere else.  e have had long negotiations with Delancey and Lendlease and have made some progress, but there is still a big gap between us.  The costs of setting up new premises are astronomical and the amount we are being offered from the relocation fund set up to help us is simply not enough.  Just lately Southwark councillors have joined the negotiations, but we still need much stronger support from the Council'.*

The owner of La Bodequita, Diana Sach, said *'I started La Bodequita in 2001, with my brothers and we worked hard to build up a successful family business.  La Bodequita and other cafes and restaurants at the Elephant and Castle helped to introduce Colombian and Latin food to London and people came from all over the city to eat with us.  We trusted Southwark Council and Delancey to help us with the relocation, but have been very disappointed.  We have spent many thousands of pounds designing new premises and storing equipment, while we have had no premises.  It is over a year since we left the shopping centre and we really need to re-open soon, but we just seem to be stuck'.*

### Successful businesses are being lost

Rakesh and Diana point out that Pricebusters and La Bodequita were both successful businesses, before they were force to move.

Rakesh says *'We did not want to move, but the decision was taken out of our hands and I am having to find a very great deal of my own money for the relocation.  I was assured by Delancey and Southwark Council that there would be aenough money in the relocation fund for us all, but so far this has not been the case'.*

Diana says *'La Bodequita is more than a restaurant.  It is part of the Elephant and Castle and part of Latin American life in London.  We want to stay here, as part of the new regeneration and are investing a lot to do this, but we need the help we were promised from Delancey and Southwark Council'.*

### 'No more Elephant as we knew it'

The traders deputation will also include Mathew Onuba, of the Look@Me stall. from the shopping centre's old market.  About a dozen displaced market traders have been in discussions with Southwark Council about setting up a small number of new pitches at teh Elephant.

Mathew says *'We have had intentions of opening up a business, but it's been a struggle.  There is no more Elephant and Castle as we knew it, there are no units, there is still no market even after trying to make plans with the Council.  Leaving a previous business and going to a new location is a hard process - it involves careful attention, publicity to attract new customers.  None of this has been provided.  We kept our goods with the promise that we would receive anew place but it never came.  I've been paying for storage up until now, with the believe and hope I could continue my business....but I would like the support from the council to continue.'*
