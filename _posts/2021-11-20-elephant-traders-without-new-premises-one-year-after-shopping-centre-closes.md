### Traders deputation seeks fair treatment from developers; urges Southwark Council to act

Independent traders displaced by the closure of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre are to send a deputation to the Southwark Council Assembly on 24 Nov 2021. The deputation will be urging the Council to do more to help them secure new premises, after being left homeless by the shopping centre closure.

Many of the Elephant's former traders have shops and cafes in Castle Square, in Elephant Rd, and in the Elephant Arcade, after a three year campaign to secure new premises, but many others are still without trading spaces, including two of the Elephant and Castle's longest standing businesses, Pricebusters DIY and La Bodequita restaurant.

Both Pricebusters and La Bodequita have been offered new premises on Elephant Park, but have been unable to reach agreement with developers Delancey and Lendlease about who will meet the relocation costs.  Southwark Council has legal agreements with both developers covering traders' relocation requirements and the deputation will be asking Southwark to enforce these agreements.

### Traders 'very disappointed'

The owner of Pricebusters, Rakesh Patel, says *'We have been trading at the Elephant for 35 years, ever since the shopping centre opened.  We were the biggest DIY shop in the area and sold things people cannot get anywhere else.  e have had long negotiations with Delancey and Lendlease and have made some progress, but there is still a big gap between us.  The costs of setting up new premises are astronomical and the amount we are being offered from the relocation fund set up to help us is simply not enough.  Just lately Southwark councillors have joined the negotiations, but we still need much stronger support from the Council'.*
