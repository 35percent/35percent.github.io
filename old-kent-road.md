excerpt: Opportunity Knocks down the Old Kent Road
---

The first stage towards knocking down the Heygate estate was to call the Elephant & Castle an 'Opportunity Area'. So anybody living on a Council estate down the Old Kent Road can be forgiven for being a little worried by Southwark's proposal to call it an Opportunity Area with a [draft Area Action Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4596/old_kent_road_area_action_plan) on top.

Southwark's ambition is to build at least 20,000 new homes within the Opportunity Area. The Council's [Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s62019/Report%20Old%20Kent%20Road%20AAP.pdf) accompanying the draft Area Action Plan says that in order to find space for the 20,000 new homes it _"would not preclude development"_ on existing housing estates, but that consultation on such proposals would be _"carried out in accordance with the principles set out in the July 2015 Cabinet report."_
